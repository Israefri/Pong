# Pong
So I had free time II


so this code not fully mine (like everyone code in this world) 
what this code do its make a game of Pong for two users one use the wasd second use the arrows
the ball get faster and when one player dont catch the ball it a point to the opponent 
pretty cool code and pretty cool way to use java lib and oop
